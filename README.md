# Simulating a Yaskawa GP7 Articulated Arm with MATLAB

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive simulation of a Yaskawa GP7 articulated robotic arm using MATLAB. It demonstrates forward/inverse kinematics and trajectory planning, serving as an educational tool for robotics and control engineering courses.

## Key Features
- **Forward Kinematics**: Compute end-effector pose from joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Solve joint angles for a given end-effector position.
- **Trajectory Planning**: Generate smooth paths using Linear Segments with Parabolic Blends (LSPB).
- **Visualization**: 3D rendering of robot motion in real time.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable functions for custom robots.
